- Open source modules are important for the community
  - In closed source you are limited by the resources of your company
  - In open source you get access to all the resources in the world :)
  - Django is very extensible and every project will need custom modules one day
- Pillars of a successful Python module
  - Purpose
  - Documentation
  - Stability
  - Community
- Purpose:
  - extract modules from working code
  - # TODO: liberate
  - scratch an itch
  - make a better solution to an already solved problem
- Documentation:
  - What makes a good README, what makes a great README
    - User documentation
    - Developer documentation!
    - important
        - how to install
        - how to ship changes
        - roadmap?
        - changelog
        - glossary
        - where to get help
  - Host documentation on [readthedocs.org](https://readthedocs.org/)
  - Keep a changelog
  - Document backwards incompatible changes
  - Generate API documentation with [Sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org/)
  - Code: always show full import paths
- Stability:
  - Your module lives in controlled chaos
    - Your dependencies change
    - Python changes
    - Django changes
  - Your contributors need an easy way to add features
  - You need a way to quickly add features
  - You need automated tests
  - Test with all versions of Python and all versions of Django using [tox](http://tox.readthedocs.org/)
  - Use [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org/) to run your tests continuously
  - Learn about Django's well documented [testing features](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/testing/)
  - 100% test coverage is dangerous
- Community:
  - Publish to [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi)
    - Specify Python 3 compatibility
  - You will receive lots of patches
    - Come up with patch requirements: tests, docs
    - Review code introduced by patches
    - Reject invalid solutions
    - Use something like GitHub for pull request, review, and merge functionality
  - Promote frequent patchers to admins
  - Create a mailing list so that all members can answer questions
  - Contributors will come and go
  - Document all project maintenance procedures
  - How to transfer maintainer duties to someone else
  - It's ok to abandon projects as long as you empower the community
    - let experts emerge (good to have multiple)
    - rotate "chores"
  - bike-shedding
    - "come with code" solves many problems
  - use a bug tracker, triage bugs
- Closing notes
  - Summary of crucial topics that were covered
  - Make great modules
  - Help develop and maintain modules you care about
  - Try patching packages before creating new ones
